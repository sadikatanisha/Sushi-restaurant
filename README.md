## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AOS

The Sushi Restaurant project is a beautifully designed website showcasing a fictional sushi restaurant. This project was built using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, JavaScript for interactivity, and AOS (Animate On Scroll) library for smooth scrolling animations. Each section of the website, from the menu to the gallery, is crafted to provide a visually appealing and seamless user experience. The AOS library was particularly useful in adding subtle yet engaging animations as users scroll through the site, enhancing the overall aesthetic and usability.

## Optimizations
To ensure optimal performance, I refactored the JavaScript code to eliminate any redundant operations, improving the overall efficiency of the website.


## Lessons Learned:

Working on the Sushi Restaurant project taught me valuable lessons in front-end development. I learned how to effectively use the AOS library to create engaging animations and improve user experience. This project also reinforced the importance of writing clean, maintainable code and optimizing performance. I had several whoa this is awesome moments, especially when seeing the animations come to life and the site performing smoothly across different devices. This experience has deepened my passion for front-end development and my commitment to continuously learning and improving my skills.
